      "Comment Body: Water is a huge symbol all over Lemonade. Specifically on Formation, she uses Katrina as a way to highlight Black trauma and the ways it has been ignored. But also to highlight the resiliency of the Black community. Katrina might have bent New Orleans, but it did not break them. Likewise, infidelity might have bent her relationship but it did not break it. Likewise, being Black in America, racism has always tried to bend us, but we will not break. The last scene is particularly powerful as you see the role reversal I talked about earlier. Now instead of the flood waters drowning Black bodies, it is the weight of Blackness, our power, our resilience, that causes the unjust systems to drown.\n",

      "I’m very interested in Black history, Black art, and Beyonce so having them all rolled into one was a real treat for me! As you can tell I’ve given the whole project a great deal of thought and have read and listened to a lot of things other folks have said about it too. It’s an artistic achievement! I think the biggest affect has been conversations! Conversations about Blackness, Black Womanhood, generational trauma and a host of other things that we typically shy away from because they aren’t always easy conversations.\n",

      "Comment Body: The Formation video is such a powerful music video! She's addressing police brutality, Black lives matters, hurricane Katrina (specifically how the US government were critizised for not responding and doing enough for the citizens of NO) and women empowerment. In the specific scene you are asking about (and this is just my opinion and analyze of the scene), I think the kid is break-dancing to show how black culture is widely popular, but still black people are victims of oppression and racism daily. Normally a black person would be the one holding his/her hands up in front of police officers, but this time the police officers are holding their hands up. They are seen as a threat to the little boy instead of the other way around. Remember Trayvon Martin was shot because they thought he looked \"threathening\" in his black hoodie. And as you can see, the kid in the music video is also wearing a black hoodie. The scene is brilliant if you ask me, and shows just how detailed Queen Bey is in her art.\n",
