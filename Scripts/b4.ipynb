      "Comment Body: They were somewhat popular here in UK I'd say, mostly with the pop crowd than any other. Kinda hard to compare to modern artists because we'd mostly consume music through TV/radio back then.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She Wants To Move\" was unavoidable, it was used in almost every advert on TV. Everyone knew it as the \"she's sexy!\" song. The video was parodied a lot on UK TV (mostly the floating red heads) but I'm not sure how much of that you'd find on the internet. Also the dancer in the video, Alesha Dixon, is a household name here and it definitely boosted the popularity of the video. She's a judge on Britain's Got Talent these days, but she was a popstar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that I remember seeing the \"Rockstar\" and \"Lapdance\" videos being on heavy rotation on the music channels. Vaguely remember \"Provider\" coming on semi-regularly too. Overall I'd say they were moderately successful, never really hit the heights of \"She Wants To Move\" again.\n",

      "Comment Body: They were never big and the only real mainstream hit was ‚ÄúShe Wants To Move‚Äù from Fly or Die. I think the credibility Pharrell had built by basically being the worlds most influential producer at the time (The Neptune‚Äôs owned the charts for like 10 years) let him have the freedom to take a risk like NERD. There was nothing like it at the time and people didn‚Äôt know what to do with it. That being said, their biggest flaw was being too ahead of their time. If ‚ÄúIn Search Of‚Äù or ‚ÄúFly or Die‚Äù were released even 10 years later they would‚Äôve been praised as genius experimental hip hop. But sadly, early 2000‚Äôs rap and rap fans had little interest. I was in 6th grade when In Search Of came out and not a soul I knew listened to it (outside of Lapdance, because it was featured in the Daredevil movie(fuck I feel old)). But it all worked out. I don‚Äôt think we have Cudi or Tyler without NERD and they still make great albums imo.\n",

      "Comment Body: We were actually acquaintances back then. He used to call me when he was in Chicago and I‚Äôd meet up with him. One of the craziest nights of my life was at this place called the Dragon Room on Emerald Ave in Chicago. It was during the Clones tour and it was P, Fam-Lay, and the Star Trak Crew (Kelis was kicked off the tour at the last stop the night before). We were MOBBED by people as soon as we walked in to the point where my friends had to be lifted into VIP. Lil Bow Wow showed up, because he‚Äôd just played the Chicago Theatre that night, and the DJ said one of the meanest things I‚Äôve ever heard and he left. It was pretty wild lol.\n",

      "Comment Body: It took me around two weeks to make. Thankfully someone had a Pharrell production discography playlist on Spotify which had most of the songs he's ever produced, so I went one by one in that playlist and saved every song with a four count start. After that I had around 170 songs I would say, and I thought I was done until I realized there were still more songs to be found if I dug deeper. So I searched in various other places until I eventually got to 209 and couldn't find anymore. But searching wasn't what took the majority of the time, it was the animation that did.\n",

      "Comment Body: The genius video from a few years back is one of my all-time favorite YouTube videos related to music. However, I‚Äôve always wished that the video had showcased more songs instead of just a select few. So for this video, I set out to find every single Pharrell four-count start that I could, and after a long journey of searching, I ended up finding 209 songs! All of which I animated for this video in mostly chronological order.  Hope you enjoy it!\n",

Great way to start üëè. You're in a Pharrell Sub and you didn't even specify if your looking for \"Neptune\" or \"NERD\" inspired sounds but are uniquely different. Even collectives like Soulection and 88Rising have a vision. You didn't even commit to an introduction of yourself. Good luck.\n",

      "Comment Body: Reading this made me feel a little sad, particularly that Kelis felt so hurt and betrayed. Especially considering their friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tremendous admiration and respect for Pharrell, Chad and Kelis. They are easily among my favorite artists, irrespective of their collaborative work. I would love to hear about the fallout from The Neptunes perspective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think to look at things perhaps from the perspective of The Neptunes would be to consider a few things. Pharrell and Chad produced and wrote all the songs on Kaleidoscope and Wanderland and they promoted her career. They are major factors that ultimately led to her success and in the 2000s it was very common for artists signed to major record labels to make little money through record sales but instead make their money through touring.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think it's possible that aspects of the disagreements around the money, contracts and stuff wasn't solely Pharrell and Chad. I mean, Kelis even mentions their management and lawyers and contracts. So perhaps some of this was out of the control of The Neptunes. When she says she was lied and tricked, it's not explicitly clear if she means by Pharrell and Chad or the managers, labels and lawyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not like I'm trying to dismiss Kelis's concerns, just trying to think about it from the other perspective. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\----\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in hindsight, hearing Kelis say she knew that The Neptunes felt very offended that Kelis didn't want to work with them exclusively, how she felt deceived and blatantly tricked, I think it's possible the song Trick Me was partially about some of the drama from the Kaleidoscope/Wanderland era  (it's worth noting it's one of the songs on the albums NOT produced by The Neptunes)\n",

      "Comment Body: Did YOU read it? You miss the point entirely and are seemingly pro toxic masculinity. The point is, masculinity isn‚Äôt defined by wearing a certain type of clothing. You can be a straight man and wear a dress, who the fuck cares. It‚Äôs like saying someone is less black because their favorite condiment is mayo and they like rock more than rap. You have constructs that have been deeply worked into your mind and have decided just because this is how things were, this is how it should stay. It‚Äôs huge that someone like Pharrell is doing this actually. Fashion has no limits or gender lines. If you feel fresh, you are. If you want Pharrell dressed like Steven fucking Segal more power to ya. I, and the bulk ok people, don‚Äôt give a shit about this stuff. It‚Äôs weird that it would get you so worked up that you‚Äôd post it on a Pharrell sub. He‚Äôs like the most open dude ever, are you even a fan?\n",
